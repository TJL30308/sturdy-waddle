Final BootCamp Project 

Machine learning ... movie analysis

Data : 

* Utilize IMDB list of movies released in the last decade https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&release_date=2010-01-01,2019-12-31&view=simple&sort=num_votes,desc&start={start}&ref_=adv_nxt

* Perform web scrape to pull first 1,000 movie titles 

* Call OMDB to return available data for those movies (JSON)

* Clean Data (drop NAN, organize lists, convert strings to ints, etc.)

* Check data quality/integritry. Is our data normal? (Histogram, boxplot)

* Create dataframe from cleaned data

* Visualize data to find any interesting trends (box office v. year; box office v. rating; box office v. year released; metascore v. year released)

* Machine Learning TBD
